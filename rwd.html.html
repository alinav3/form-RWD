  <h1> What is RWD?</h1>
  <p> 
    Responsive web design (RWD) helps users view your website on any device they have. Basically, it allows your website to adapt and be accessible for all your clients. The number of devices is constantly growing and they come in a wide range of sizes, from the tiniest like Smart Watches, to huge (more than 250 inches) TVs.
</p>
  
<p>
  To make a website responsive, it should be designed on a flexible grid. That grid will allow the elements on your website to resize and rearrange themselves on userâ€™s screens, so your website will look more professional on every screen. 
</p>
  
<p>
  Having a responsive website, allows your company or brand, to have the best appearance on the web. As a result, Google will rank you higher on its research pages, so your prospect customers could find you faster. All of that will help your business to grow, sell your product/service better and basically make more profit.
